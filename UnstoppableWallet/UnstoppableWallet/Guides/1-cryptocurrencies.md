# Blockchains Explained

The aim of this guide is to onboard someone with little knowledge about cryptocurrencies to the comfortable level as quickly as possible.

Cryptocurrencies are powered by a number of technologies, but primarily a blockchain technology. The blockchain technology used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin was built around a principle that 'no party can be trusted'. 

The technology designed in a way where doing anything outside the scope of agreed rules becomes impossible. When using a product built on top of such blockchain following statements hold true:

- user doesn't have to trust anyone on a blockchain
- user doesn't need permission to participate in blockchain
- user has an unconditional control over assets on a blockchain
- blockchain data is permanent and unchangeable

Blockchain tech can potentially be applied to anything where notions like trust, censorship-resistance and immutability are essential. It can be used for things like elections, notary services, financial instruments and so on.

At the time being, a large chunk of financial, legal and governmental agencies exist to enforce things that can be enforced by blockchain technology in impartial manner. 

> The first generation of blockchain-based products like Bitcoin aim to deliver a financial platform for value exchange without the need for a system to rely on intermediaries such as banks. 

Should the blockchain technology continue to grow these services are likely to be automated and ported over to a blockchain.

Think about the transformation in telecommunication industry where not so long ago text messaging and voice calling were the main revenue sources. The emergence of messaging services i.e. Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp completely changed that.

That Bitcoin is the first product where the idea of blockchain was applied to challenge areas currently controlled by present day monetary system.

## Blockchain Attributes

So, what is a blockchain? While so many definitions make it sound complicated it's fairly simple in reality.

> Without going technical, think about a blockchain as a chronological history of records. 
>
> It can be a history of transactions, a history of votes submitted by electorates etc. 

While the actual history of records is not that special in itself, when it's put on a blockchain it gains certain attributes that make it socially valuable. These attributes are:

* Distributed Nature

    Instead of being held in one centralized location, the blockchain allows for the 'history of records' to be held in thousands or millions of locations at the same time. Every copy connected to the internet gets updated in close to real time.   

* Peer-to-peer Transmission

    Anyone can add new records to a global 'history of records' by communicating with any entity out of thousands that keeps the records. This ensures availability 24/7 and unconditional access to participation.  

* Transparency & Pseudonymity

    Blockchains are generally transparent where the entire 'history of records' is public and accessible for anyone for scrutiny. While all records are public the entities involved in those records are masked. Any third party can see what's taking place but can't tell who exactly was involved.

* Irreversibility Of Records

    The blockchains are designed in a way where after an action took place it's impossible to change it. This ensures that no entity is able to change something in the history of records.

* Business Logic

    In our 'history of records' example we might have unintentionally assumed that these records are of specific type like "User1 paid User2 X bitcoins". The present day blockchain technologies allow adding conditional logic to records. Instead of regular 'A paid B x bitcoins' it can have a record like 'A paid B x bitcoins, but B can't spend them for 10 years'.
   
So, blockchains are a lot more than just plain history of records. The technology opened up ways for a society to organize and exchange in ways that previously required a third party to operate.

## Cryptocurrencies Explained

Now when you're familiar with the concept of blockchains lets try to understand the basic nature of cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrencies are units of something on the blockchain. Depending on the characteristics of underlying blockchain one cryptocurrency may vary from another.

For instance:

- Bitcoin cryptocurrency is a native unit of measurement on the Bitcoin blockchain. It's denoted by a 'BTC' symbol. A single unit of Bitcoin is divisible into 100 million sub-units called Satoshi. By design Bitcoin blockchain caps the total amount to 21 million Bitcoins. The Bitcoin blockchain limited in the type of records it can store, mostly it's used to transfer bitcoins from one address to another.

- Ether cryptocurrency is a native unit of measurement on Ethereum blockchain, denoted by a 'ETH' symbol. A single unit of Ethereum consists of 100,000,000,000,000,000 wei. Unlike the Bitcoin, Ethereum blockchain doesn't cap the amount of Ethers that can potentially exist on the blockchain. Ethereum blockchain doesn't put any limitations in a type of records it can hold. 

Some blockchains (such as Ethereum) enable ways to create your own 'units of something' for whatever purpose. These are often referred to as cryptocurrency tokens and can be used for various purposes as will be shown later.

### How Cryptocurrencies Grow

Many people wonder why there are so many cryptocurrencies and tokens out there and why some are more popular or expensive than others. To give you an idea check out the rankings on [CoinMarketCap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com).

> A size of the underlying network is what makes one cryptocurrency more valuable than the other.

Some cryptocurrencies are unique in the way the underlying blockchain is built. However, since blockchains are open-source anyone can take any blockchain and launch a duplicate without much effort. 

In that regard, the duplicate won't really be any different from original substantially except for the size of the network. 

A simple way to think about the size of the network is looking at the number of people interacting with the blockchain. 

1. The more parties there are participating on the blockchain the bigger is its network. 

2. As the blockchain network grows so is the security and decentralization of the blockchain.

3. As the network grows further the blockchain becomes an independent and open platform for anyone to participate and offer services.

A good example to illustrate this is the Bitcoin blockchain. 

The Bitcoin blockchain launched in 2009 and what initially was a fun toy for a small group of people managed to attract millions of people over the years. 

Nowadays, thousands of people run Bitcoin blockchain servers on their computers. By keeping a live copy of the Bitcoin blockchain (history of records) these participants act as both keepers and validators of records. Every single one of them. 

This status quo makes Bitcoin both global and censorship-resistant platform that is open to all. 

The fact that Bitcoin and alike platforms are open and censorship-resistant means that any individual can start participating in the ecosystem. That participation can take place both in a form of a regular user or even a service provider. 

For example, any entity can build a wallet or some other service for Bitcoin blockchain without the need for a permission from a third party.

> The bigger the blockchain platform is the more attractive it's for the service providers. 

So, along with the above mentioned blockchain attributes the key element to valuing blockchain is its network size. 

The most valuable cryptocurrency is generally the one with the biggest network and not necessarily the one with most features. 

The bigger the blockchain network is, the more attractive it as the platform of choice for potential services.
