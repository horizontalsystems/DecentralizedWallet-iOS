The way most wallets construct transactions makes it easy for a third party monitoring Bitcoin blockchain to understand which of the outputs went to the receiving party and which one was the change returned to the sender. The output returned to the sender can then be used in future transactions and further reveal the details to the monitoring party.\n\nUnstoppable wallet implements measures to makes it significantly harder to figure out which output goes where. There are two options available to Unstoppable users:\n\n1. Shuffle : The order of transaction outputs are randomized on every transaction. Sometimes change can be the first output, sometimes it can be the second. If a user trusts the developer of the app, then this is regarded as the recommended option.\n\n2. Deterministic : There is a commonly agreed standard for ordering transaction outputs (known as BIP69). In open source wallets that standard ensures that wallet users do not need to trust how developers of the app implement the ordering of the outputs. As this standard is new, not many wallets have implemented it yet. As a result, it's somewhat possible to see on the blockchain whether transaction was sent from the wallet that uses that standard or not.";

Third party services can potentially record IP addresses and the requests made. That info can reveal location, balance, transactions etc. Moreover, the wallet has to trust that information returned is correct. There is a an alternative known as Incubed which in essence is a network of special Ethereum nodes. These nodes can also record IP addresses and requests made, but they are chosen randomly each time. While being slightly slower than Infura, the way Incubed works pretty much guarantees that the information returned is correct (not fake).\n\nWhen it comes to other blockchains like EOSIO and Binance Chain, at this point they only provide centralized means of connecting, without viable alternatives.

This method is fast but can potentially keep track of the IP addresses and the data requested. This option is recommended due to its speed of getting data (5-10 minutes). The risks are minimal. If the user restoring from his own server then no privacy risks at all.\n\n2. from Blockchain : In this case the app tries to restore directly from a p2p network of the blockchain nodes. The app pings many of those nodes and requests data from them. Potentially these nodes can keep track of user's IP address and requests made however during restore the app can switch between nodes.
